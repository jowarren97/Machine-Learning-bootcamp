REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

3 types:
Supervised
Unsupervised
Reinforcement learning (RL) - good for evolving dataset i.e. interaction w environment

Deep RL = Q networks + deep neural networks

Reward - single scalar value e.g. +1 for chess win, -1 for loss
Reward must be defined by environment or researcher
What are the correct rewards? Objectives vs values

Want to maximise future reward (not just short term immediate reward)
